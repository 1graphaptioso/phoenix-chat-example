# Adding Auth üîê in 5 Minutes!

</div>

The process of adding protected routes and authentication 
to a `Phoenix` App can be quite a few steps ...
Luckily there there is a tool 
[that we built; shameless plug]
that can significantly simplify the process!

In this guide we'll show the steps 
for adding **auth** using 
[**`auth_plug`**](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug)
in **5 minutes**.
We'll add **_optional_ `auth`**
that will let people authenticate 
with their **`GitHub`** or **`Google`** Account
and use their Account username and Avatar in the Chat. 

Let's do this!

  - [1. Add `auth_plug` to `mix.exs`](#1-add-auth_plug-to-mixexs)
  - [2. Making index route with login page.](#2-making-index-route-with-login-page)

## 1. Add `auth_plug` to `mix.exs`

We are using 
[**`auth_plug`**](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug)
which will serve as 
["***middleware***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware)
for handling auth in the Chat App.

Here's a quick rundown 
of the steps:

1. Add **`auth_plug`** to **`deps`** in **`mix.exs`**, 
   then run `$ mix deps.get`.
2. Visit [authdemo.fly.dev](https://authdemo.fly.dev/),
   sign in with `GitHub` 
   and create your app with `localhost:4000` url 
(or whatever port you're running your Phoenix app)
1. Save the shown `AUTH_API_KEY` environment variable 
  or make sure you run the application 
  with the `export` command with this env variable.
4. Add `auth_plug` to your `router.ex` file 
   by creating a new pipeline and adding it to run through your protected route.

```elixir
  pipeline :auth, do: plug(AuthPlug)

  scope "/", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    pipe_through :auth
    get "/admin", PageController, :admin
  end
```

5. You're done! Your protected route now redirects you to a page where you sign in with whatever option you want.

## 2. Making index route with login page.

It's a bit useless having a protected router path that does nothing but just...be protected. Instead, we should
add these auth capabilities to our main page and let the user *have the option* to login with Github or Google Drive
and use their username in following interactions!
